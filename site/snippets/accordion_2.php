        <p>Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show to
            the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more
            shows.</p>

        <p>Like you, I used to think the world was this great place where everybody lived by the same standards I did,
            then some kid with a nail showed me I was living in his world, a world where chaos rules not order, a world
            where righteousness is not rewarded. That's Cesar's world, and if you're not willing to play by his rules,
            then you're gonna have to pay the price. </p>

        <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the
            world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don't
            know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five
            made it out. Now we took an oath, that I'm breaking now. We said we'd say it was the snow that killed the
            other two, but it wasn't. Nature is lethal but it doesn't hold a candle to man. </p>

        <p>You see? It's curious. Ted did figure it out - time travel. And when we get back, we gonna tell everyone. How
            it's possible, how it's done, what the dangers are. But then why fifty years in the future when the
            spacecraft encounters a black hole does the computer call it an 'unknown entry event'? Why don't they know?
            If they don't know, that means we never told anyone. And if we never told anyone it means we never made it
            back. Hence we die down here. Just as a matter of deductive logic. </p>
